            description : 'Hello! My name is Janet Meinke-Lau. I am a watercolor artist based in Honolulu, Hawaii. I like to paint and draw what I see, and lucky for me, I am surrounded by natural beauty in Hawaii. My watercolor and ink paintings are inspired by nature, landscapes, sea life, buildings, and people. I hope my artwork kindles a desire in viewers to go in the ocean, to look closer at the leaves of plants and petals of flowers, to walk around a historic downtown area, and to appreciate how unique all of our faces (and personalities) are. Beauty surrounds us everywhere, and we are all connected. I hope that my art also encourages others to create and express who they truly are.',
