        title : "THE HEALING JOURNEY",
        date : "JUNE 19, 2023",
        textContent1 : "This collection is inspired by my journey of healing and personal growth. In the midst of a difficult separation and eventual divorce, I started filling my home with indoor plants. There was something satisfying about taking care of living things. Paying attention, understanding the conditions each plant needs for thriving, moving them around in my home and testing light sources, keeping track of watering schedules. While I nurtured the plants, I was also nurturing myself – observing and attending to my own needs: sleep; water time/surf; being around people who cared about my well-being; and alone time to process my grief. Journaling, meandering walks, and bath bombs also helped. I am an extrovert who’s good at making plans and not good at staying home and doing nothing. The plants helped to keep me in check. Was I home enough to water my plants regularly? Was I giving myself enough rest and self-care? What was I trying to heal from?",
        textContent2 : "Pain. The pain of lost love. The pain of abandonment (as I perceived it) and not feeling good enough. The pain of self-betrayal - not listening to myself, my intuition. The pain of not being able to give my son the experience of a nuclear family, of not being there for half his life. And going back further, deeper… the pain of childhood loneliness. My immigrant parents did the best they could in the circumstances they were in, but emotionally and physically they were unavailable. Heartbreak forced me to finally face my own fears, hurt, and other negative emotions which are all too easy to ignore. But facing them is required for healing.",
        textContent3 : "Eventually it paves the way for the good stuff - joy, wisdom, love. Other outcomes of being healed include: Peace in my mind and in my heart. Kindness. I show kindness to myself for being imperfect. I show kindness and grace to others for being imperfect too. Forgiveness. Letting go of grudges and resentment. Forgiveness is for ourselves, not for others.Improved relationships. The freedom to choose how to respond instead of react. Taking responsibility for my own emotions, and not for the emotions of others. My peace is my power. I am learning to feel my emotions and let them go, but it’s not easy and I must continually work at it. As I grow my love for myself, my capacity to love others grows. To heal the world, we start with healing ourselves."

        title : "SURF + ART = LOVE",
        date : "AUGUST 9, 2023",
        textContent1 : "The fusion of surf and art is a symphony of emotions, a dance of the soul. It's not just about catching waves or creating a masterpiece; it's about the connection between the two. The rhythm of the waves mirrors the strokes of the brush, each telling a story of passion and beauty. The board becomes the canvas, the sea the paint. The surfer becomes the artist, the ocean the muse. And in this harmonious blend, love is born - a love for the surf, a love for art, a love for life itself.",
        textContent2 : "As the surfer glides across the water, carving lines and curves, they are painting a picture of movement and grace. The colors of the ocean - turquoise, azure, cerulean - blend seamlessly with the colors of the sky - pink, orange, gold. The sun, a giant ball of fire, casts its warm glow over everything, creating a scene of breathtaking beauty. And as the surfer rides the wave, they become one with the ocean, one with the art, one with the love that surrounds them.",

        title : "GET THAT BOARD INTO WATER",
        date : "OCTOBER 13, 2023",
        textContent1 : "Why spend a fortune on a fancy board if it's just going to collect dust? Sure, it looks great hanging on your wall, but it's meant to be ridden, not admired from afar. So, stop procrastinating and get that board into water! It doesn't matter if you're a beginner or a pro, the ocean is calling, and your board is waiting. Remember, it's not about the board; it's about the experience.",
        textContent2 : "So, whether you're shredding waves or just paddling around, the most important thing is to enjoy the ride. And speaking of boards, let's talk about the different types. There's the shortboard, the longboard, the fish, the funboard, the gun, and the hybrid. Each one has its own unique characteristics and is suited to different types of waves and conditions. But here's the thing: you don't need the latest, most expensive board to have fun. In fact, some of the best rides can be had on a beat-up old board that's been passed down from generation to generation. So, don't get caught up in the hype. Just get out there and ride.",

        title : "NATURE SPIRIT : ABOVE MOUNTAINS",
        date : "NOVEMBER 12, 2023",
        textContent1 : "The mountains are more than just a backdrop; they're a source of inspiration. Their majestic beauty, their tranquil silence, their untamed wilderness - all of it speaks to the soul. And with watercolor, you can capture that essence like no other medium. The transparency and fluidity of watercolor allow you to create mountains that seem to breathe, that seem to come alive on the page. It's not just about painting a picture; it's about capturing the spirit of nature itself.",
        textContent2 : "So, let the mountains guide your hand, and let your imagination soar above them. And as you paint, remember that each stroke is a reflection of your own inner landscape. The mountains are a metaphor for the challenges we face in life - the peaks and valleys, the highs and lows. But they are also a symbol of our resilience, our strength, our ability to rise above. So, paint with purpose, paint with passion, and let your art be a testament to the beauty of the human spirit.",
